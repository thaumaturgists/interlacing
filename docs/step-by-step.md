============================
```
To work in any language, I need python to check every character against a dictionary, chara_here.txt. if the character is not in chara_here.txt, then it is added to it. After that it done, I need python code to grab every word recognizing _ as a space, and put them in a folder in chunks of 100,000 lines max.
```
============================

To accomplish your task, we can break it down into two main parts:

1. **Check each character against a dictionary (`chara_here.txt`) and add any new characters to it.**
2. **Extract words from the provided list, treating underscores (`_`) as spaces, and save them in chunks of 100,000 lines each.**

Here's a Python script that implements both parts:

```python
import os

# Define the paths
input_folder = 'chunky/'
output_folder = 'output_chunks/'
dictionary_file = 'chara_here.txt'

# Ensure the output folder exists
os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Part 1: Check characters against the dictionary and update it
def update_dictionary(input_folder, dictionary_file):
    # Read existing characters from the dictionary
    with open(dictionary_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        existing_chars = set(f.read().strip())

    # Iterate through each chunk folder
    for chunk_folder in os.listdir(input_folder):
        chunk_path = os.path.join(input_folder, chunk_folder)
        if os.path.isdir(chunk_path):
            for filename in os.listdir(chunk_path):
                file_path = os.path.join(chunk_path, filename)
                with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    for line in f:
                        for char in line.strip():
                            if char not in existing_chars:
                                existing_chars.add(char)

    # Write updated characters back to the dictionary
    with open(dictionary_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(''.join(sorted(existing_chars)))

# Part 2: Extract words and save them in chunks
def extract_words_and_chunk(input_folder, output_folder):
    all_words = []
    
    # Iterate through each chunk folder
    for chunk_folder in os.listdir(input_folder):
        chunk_path = os.path.join(input_folder, chunk_folder)
        if os.path.isdir(chunk_path):
            for filename in os.listdir(chunk_path):
                file_path = os.path.join(chunk_path, filename)
                with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    for line in f:
                        # Replace underscores with spaces and split into words
                        words = line.strip().replace('_', ' ').split()
                        all_words.extend(words)

    # Save words in chunks of 100,000 lines
    for i in range(0, len(all_words), 100000):
        chunk_words = all_words[i:i + 100000]
        chunk_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'chunk_{i // 100000 + 1}.txt')
        with open(chunk_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write('\n'.join(chunk_words))

# Run the functions
update_dictionary(input_folder, dictionary_file)
extract_words_and_chunk(input_folder, output_folder)

print("Processing complete.")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Directory Setup**: The script defines the input folder (`chunky/`), output folder (`output_chunks/`), and the dictionary file (`chara_here.txt`). It ensures the output folder exists.

2. **Updating the Dictionary**:
   - The `update_dictionary` function reads existing characters from `chara_here.txt`.
   - It iterates through each file in the specified folders, checking each character in the lines against the existing characters.
   - If a character is not found, it adds it to the set of existing characters.
   - Finally, it writes the updated set of characters back to the dictionary file.

3. **Extracting Words and Chunking**:
   - The `extract_words_and_chunk` function reads each file, replaces underscores with spaces, and splits the lines into words.
   - It collects all words into a list and then saves them in chunks of 100,000 lines each into separate text files in the output folder.

### Usage:
- Make sure to place the script in the same directory as the `chunky/` folder and the `chara_here.txt` file.
- Run the script, and it will process the files as described.

This script should meet your requirements effectively. Let me know if you need any modifications or further assistance!

===================================
```
Is this optimised to be safe for my system so it will not be overwhelmed?
```
===================================

The provided script is designed to be efficient and should generally be safe for your system, but there are a few considerations and optimizations you can implement to ensure it runs smoothly without overwhelming your system:

### Considerations for Safety and Performance:

1. **Memory Management**:
   - The script reads all words into memory before writing them to files. If the total number of words is extremely large, this could consume a lot of memory. To mitigate this, you can process and write each file's words immediately instead of accumulating them in a list.

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Instead of reading all files at once, you can process them in smaller batches. This can help manage memory usage and reduce the risk of overwhelming the system.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling to manage issues like file access errors or encoding problems. This will prevent the script from crashing unexpectedly.

4. **Logging**:
   - Adding logging can help you monitor the script's progress and identify any issues that arise during execution.

5. **Resource Limits**:
   - If you're running this on a system with limited resources, consider adding sleep intervals or limiting the number of files processed in a single run.

### Optimized Version of the Script:

Hereâ€™s an updated version of the script that incorporates some of these considerations:

```python
import os

# Define the paths
input_folder = 'chunky/'
output_folder = 'output_chunks/'
dictionary_file = 'chara_here.txt'

# Ensure the output folder exists
os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Part 1: Check characters against the dictionary and update it
def update_dictionary(input_folder, dictionary_file):
    # Read existing characters from the dictionary
    with open(dictionary_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        existing_chars = set(f.read().strip())

    # Iterate through each chunk folder
    for chunk_folder in os.listdir(input_folder):
        chunk_path = os.path.join(input_folder, chunk_folder)
        if os.path.isdir(chunk_path):
            for filename in os.listdir(chunk_path):
                file_path = os.path.join(chunk_path, filename)
                try:
                    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                        for line in f:
                            for char in line.strip():
                                existing_chars.add(char)  # Add new characters
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error reading {file_path}: {e}")

    # Write updated characters back to the dictionary
    with open(dictionary_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(''.join(sorted(existing_chars)))

# Part 2: Extract words and save them in chunks
def extract_words_and_chunk(input_folder, output_folder):
    word_count = 0
    chunk_index = 1
    chunk_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'chunk_{chunk_index}.txt')
    
    # Open the first chunk file for writing
    chunk_file = open(chunk_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8')

    # Iterate through each chunk folder
    for chunk_folder in os.listdir(input_folder):
        chunk_path = os.path.join(input_folder, chunk_folder)
        if os.path.isdir(chunk_path):
            for filename in os.listdir(chunk_path):
                file_path = os.path.join(chunk_path, filename)
                try:
                    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                        for line in f:
                            # Replace underscores with spaces and split into words
                            words = line.strip().replace('_', ' ').split()
                            for word in words:
                                chunk_file.write(word + '\n')
                                word_count += 1
                                # Check if we need to create a new chunk file
                                if word_count >= 100000:
                                    chunk_file.close()
                                    chunk_index += 1
                                    chunk_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f'chunk_{chunk_index}.txt')
                                    chunk_file = open(chunk_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8')
                                    word_count = 0
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error reading {file_path}: {e}")

    # Close the last chunk file
    chunk_file.close()

# Run the functions
update_dictionary(input_folder, dictionary_file)
extract_words_and_chunk(input_folder, output_folder)

print("Processing complete.")
```

### Key Changes:
- **Immediate Writing**: The script writes each word to the output file immediately, reducing memory usage.
- **Error Handling**: Added try-except blocks to handle potential file reading errors gracefully.
- **Chunk File Management**: The script manages chunk files dynamically, creating new files as needed without accumulating all words in memory.

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Test on a Small Dataset**: Before running the script on the entire dataset, test it on a smaller subset to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Monitor System Resources**: Keep an eye on CPU and memory usage while the

# Sorts The Output Chunks

To create a new script that sorts the output chunks and checks against the `all_words` folder, we will follow these steps:

1. **Read all words from the `all_words` folder and store them in a set for quick lookup.**
2. **Iterate through the sorted output chunks and check each word against the set of existing words.**
3. **If a word is not found, add it to a new file in the `all_words` folder, ensuring that no file exceeds 150,000 lines.**
4. **If the current file reaches the limit, create a new file.**

Hereâ€™s the Python script that implements this logic:

```python
import os

# Define the paths
output_folder = 'output_chunks/'
all_words_folder = 'all_words/'

# Ensure the all_words folder exists
os.makedirs(all_words_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Function to read all words from the all_words folder into a set
def load_existing_words(all_words_folder):
    existing_words = set()
    for filename in os.listdir(all_words_folder):
        file_path = os.path.join(all_words_folder, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                for line in f:
                    existing_words.add(line.strip())
    return existing_words

# Function to add new words to the all_words folder
def add_new_words(output_folder, all_words_folder):
    existing_words = load_existing_words(all_words_folder)
    new_words = []
    current_file_index = 1
    current_file_path = os.path.join(all_words_folder, f'words_{current_file_index}.txt')
    
    # Ensure the first file is created
    if not os.path.exists(current_file_path):
        with open(current_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            pass  # Create an empty file

    # Iterate through each chunk file in the output folder
    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(output_folder)):
        file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                for line in f:
                    word = line.strip()
                    if word and word not in existing_words:
                        new_words.append(word)
                        existing_words.add(word)  # Add to existing words to avoid duplicates
                        
                        # Check if we need to write to a new file
                        if len(new_words) >= 150000:
                            with open(current_file_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as out_file:
                                out_file.write('\n'.join(new_words) + '\n')
                            new_words = []  # Reset the list for the next batch
                            current_file_index += 1
                            current_file_path = os.path.join(all_words_folder, f'words_{current_file_index}.txt')

    # Write any remaining new words to the last file
    if new_words:
        with open(current_file_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as out_file:
            out_file.write('\n'.join(new_words) + '\n')

# Run the function to add new words
add_new_words(output_folder, all_words_folder)

print("New words processing complete.")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Loading Existing Words**:
   - The `load_existing_words` function reads all files in the `all_words` folder and stores the words in a set for fast lookup.

2. **Adding New Words**:
   - The `add_new_words` function iterates through the sorted output chunk files.
   - For each word, it checks if it exists in the set of existing words. If not, it adds the word to a list of new words.
   - When the list of new words reaches 150,000, it writes them to the current output file in the `all_words` folder. If the current file is full, it creates a new file.

3. **File Management**:
   - The script ensures that each file in the `all_words` folder does not exceed 150,000 lines.

### Usage:
- Place this script in the same directory as the `output_chunks` and `all_words` folders.
- Run the script, and it will process the output chunks and update the `all_words` folder accordingly.

This script should efficiently manage the addition of new words while keeping the file sizes within the specified limits. Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance!
